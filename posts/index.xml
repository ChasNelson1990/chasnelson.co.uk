      <description>Research Interests My research interests focus on two scientific areas:
 Bringing together hardware, software and wetware in the pursuit of high quality, quantitative and smart bioimaging; Innovative data-driven solutions for bioimage analysis to accelerate biological discovery.  Both of these areas requires the integration of skills from computing, physics and the life sciences. As such, my research career has moved me between disciplines and involves a large number of cross-disciplinary collaborations.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s now been two weeks since I attended the Royal Society&amp;rsquo;s Research Culture - Changing Expectations meeting and it&amp;rsquo;s amazing how many topics from the meetings have come up organically in conversations with other academics, particularly early career researchers. I&amp;rsquo;ve already written about a few of these in my earlier post and in this post I&amp;rsquo;ll summarise some key topics from the second day.
As mentioned in my last post this and my last post are a brief summary of just some of the ideas and messages that particularly spoke to me.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week (29-30th October 2018) I attended a meeting at the Royal Society (London) with an aim of considering the UK scientific research culture - identifying challenges, highlighting best practice and considering what the future UK research culture can and should be. This meeting is a culmination of a two year programme of events and consultations (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/research-culture/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting was full of inspiring speakers and great ideas and this and my next post are a really very brief summary of just some of the ideas and messages that particularly spoke to me. I have referenced speakers throughout but some of these points may be my own interpretation and opinion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2018 has been a busy year so far (and I expect it will stay that way) but I’ve finally made time to write another blog post (and also to move my blog into my personal website). Given that so far this year I’ve spoken about my current research - imaging the beating zebrafish heart - to audiences of academics, the public &amp;amp; students I thought it was about time to do a blog post summarising said research. Hopefully this short post will provide you with an idea of what we’re trying to achieve, why and how we’re going about it (although I&amp;rsquo;ve kept off too much detail for now).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Better Imaging of Living Animals and the 3Rs</title>
      <link>/posts/the-little-eye/better-imaging-and-the-3rs/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 10 Nov 2017 16:04:39 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/posts/the-little-eye/better-imaging-and-the-3rs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I was explaining my research to another academic from a different field. I was describing how, when imaging living animals under the microscope, we strive to keep laser power levels to the minimum needed. The question I got in return was: &amp;ldquo;Is that for the animal&amp;rsquo;s sake or for the imaging?&amp;rdquo;. And of course the answer is both - in general, I find that good science and better microscopy align very well with performing more humane animal research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is about how researchers are working to improve animal research by minimising numbers used, sharing animals and data and refining experimental procedures.  This is not an article on whether or not animal experimentation should or should not be done; that is a matter of personal ethics. However, should you be interested in the rules and regulations surrounding animal research in the UK, I would suggest you start with Understanding Animal Research &lt;a href=&#34;#understanding&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; and the National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (the NC3RS) &lt;a href=&#34;#nc3rs&#34;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I attended the Sense about Science &lt;a href=&#34;#sas&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; media workshop: Standing up for Science &lt;a href=&#34;#workshop&#34;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;. The day is run as part of their Voice of Young Science network &lt;a href=&#34;#voys&#34;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; and aims to help early career scientists launch themselves into the rather intimidating field of media engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workshop itself was a really interesting day so thanks to Chris Peters and Ana Skamarauskas for organising and chairing through the day. It was primarily composed of three very interactive panels: scientists who have communicated with the media, journalists who work in STEM-related media, and the &amp;rsquo;nuts and bolts&amp;rsquo; panel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Antony van Leeuwenhoek is one of the most well known figures in the history of microscopy. He is particularly known for two achievements: his single-lens microscopes, the best of which was able to resolve objects down to 1 micrometre (a thousandth of a millimetre), and being the first human to explore the microcosm - the world of single-cell organisms such as algae and bacteria. It is for the latter that he is often ascribed the sobriquet of &amp;lsquo;The Father of Microbiology&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;light-is-an-essential-aspect-of-microscopy&#34;&gt;Light is an Essential Aspect of Microscopy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An essential aspect to microscopy is light. Early microscopes used ambient light or used mirrors to reflect light, either from the sun or a candle, onto the sample of interest. With the inventions &lt;a href=&#34;#bulb&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; of the electric light bulb additional, artificial light sources could be used and the light from lamps could be focussed onto samples with much greater control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Future of UK Life Sciences</title>

      <guid>/posts/the-little-eye/future-of-uk-life-sciences/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last month the House of Lords Science and Technology Select Committee, which scrutinises Government policy relating to science and technology, announced an inquiry into the future of UK life sciences &lt;a href=&#34;#lsis&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. This is off the back of the Government&amp;rsquo;s Industrial Strategy Green Paper &lt;a href=&#34;#industry&#34;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; and aims to investigate, amongst other things, whether or not the Government has the infrastructure to support an innovative life sciences sector in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As somebody with a passion for bioimaging I thought I might stress the importance of bioimaging and similar supporting technologies. Without technologies such as bioimaging and next generation sequencing, the UK biosciences and bioeconomy would not be the innovative and world-class scene that it is. So, here it is, my two pence worth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many modern microscopes can be large, highly technical and expensive pieces of equipment. This is most evidenced when you consider that, when funding such equipment at UK universities and research institutes, many funding bodies stipulate a requirement for sharing across multiple research groups or institutes. However, as developers of new microscopy technology a focus on such fancy and costly microscopes should not be at the detriment of the continued research into miniaturisation, cheaper manufacturing and improved transportable microscopes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A quick note: the title of this post is perhaps a bit false - this post will actually only give a brief history of the founding of the Microscopical Society of London. The Microscopical Society of London was the original name of what is now known as the Royal Microscopical Society. I hope to do a number of posts about the society, which is a very important learned society founded to promote,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;microscopical investigation, and for the introduction and improvement of the Microscope as a scientific instrument &lt;a href=&#34;#T1989&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The History of Microscopy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So this week I want to introduce a new project I&amp;rsquo;m starting: an interactive timeline of the history of microscopy. The idea behind this is to slowly build up an educational resource that documents key events and people in the history of microscopy. Eventually this timeline will go from the first compound microscopes, through electron and fluorescence microscopy and right up to modern techniques such as lightsheet and super-resolution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This Tuesday (the 20th June 2017) I attended a workshop on the new &lt;em&gt;Technology Touching Life&lt;/em&gt; scheme being run by three of the UK&amp;rsquo;s research councils &lt;a href=&#34;#ttl&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. The workshops (this was the last of three) were run jointly by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), the Engineering and Physical Sciences Reseasrch Council (EPSRC) and the Medical Research Council (MRC) to foster multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary networks and better integrate such research into the often disciplinary nature of the research councils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the current changes in the research council structure, and the regularly recognised important of multidisciplinary research at this interface, can we expect to see a change in how the councils work together for better multidisciplinary research across the UK?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-me&#34;&gt;About Me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi! My name is &lt;strong&gt;Chas Nelson&lt;/strong&gt; and I&amp;rsquo;m an interdisciplinary scientist with a background in computational microscopy and bioimaging. My research interests are at the interface where microscopy, computer science and biology must come together to answer important biological questions. I&amp;rsquo;m also very interested in multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity as concepts across teaching, research, funding and policy. I&amp;rsquo;m the author of this little blog and you can find out more about me at my &lt;a href=&#34;/&#34;&gt;personal webpages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
