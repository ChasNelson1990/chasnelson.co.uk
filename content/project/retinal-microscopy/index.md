As an EPSRC Doctoral Prize Research Fellow (University of Glasgow) I have begun to explore the challenges of imaging eye development in zebrafish. The two key challenges are the optical power of the eye lens, which focusses light in a way undesirable for imaging, and the light-sensitive nature of the retina.
