As an EPSRC Doctoral Prize Research Fellow (University of Glasgow), I am investigated the use of graph theory, the mathematical background to network science, to understand how networks of neurons change organisation throughout development. In particular, I am developing analysis pipelines for the quantitative exploration of retinal development as measured by multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings and calcium imaging.
