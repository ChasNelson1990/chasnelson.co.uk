Working with Cigdem Sazak and [Boguslaw Obara](https://community.dur.ac.uk/boguslaw.obara/) (Durham University) I developed a new approach for the enhancement of vessel-like objects in biological and medical imaging called the bowler-hat transform. We have used this approach in the analysis of fungal and slime mould networks, with our collaborator Mark Fricker (Oxford University), retinal imaging and brain vasculature.

My contribution to this work was funded by the EPSRC.

The key output of this work was published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2018.10.011" target="_blank">Pattern Recognition</a>.
