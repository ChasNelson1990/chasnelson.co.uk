Working with colleagues at Durham University, I developed new approaches for the enhancement of vessel-like objects in 2D and 3D biological and medical imaging.
One technique, the bowler-hat transform, we have used in the analysis 2D retinal fundus images, 3D brain vasculature in MRA data and for fungal and slime mould networks, with our collaborator Mark Fricker (Oxford University).

My contribution to this work was funded by the EPSRC.
