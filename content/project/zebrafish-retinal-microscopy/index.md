As a LKAS Research Fellow in Data Science and, previously, an EPSRC Doctoral Prize Research Fellow (University of Glasgow) I have been exploring the challenges of imaging eye development in zebrafish.
The two key challenges are the optical power of the eye lens, which focusses light in a way undesirable for imaging, and the light-sensitive nature of the retina.

This work is funded by my LKAS Research Fellowship in Data Science and, previously, my EPSRC Doctoral Prize Research Fellowship (University of Glasgow).
