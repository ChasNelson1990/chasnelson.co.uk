I am an interdisciplinary scientist with a background in quantitative microscopy and bioimage analysis working in the Imaging Concepts Group at the University of Glasgow.

My research interests are focussed on using advanced biological imaging and quantitative methods to study retinal development in zebrafish, a model organism.
In particular, Iâ€™m interested in how neuronal networks in the retina develop fundamental image processing capabilities.
