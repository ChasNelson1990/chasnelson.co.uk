title: "Imaging the Beating Zebrafish Heart"
event: "7 Minutes of Science"
event_url: "https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/7-minutes-of-science-tickets-54718322977#"
location: "Glasgow, UK"
summary:
abstract: "Biology is the study of life and most life is four-dimensional (space and time), but for years it has been studied using dead samples and often in only two-dimensions. Our research has developed new techniques that combine optics and computing to image the living, beating heart in zebrafish, a model organism for cardiac disease and injury. This new approach is able to 'computationally freeze' the heart and capture three-dimensional time-lapses of heart development and injury response in a non-invasive and minimally harmful way reducing the impact on the animals used whilst enabling better and new biology to be explored."
