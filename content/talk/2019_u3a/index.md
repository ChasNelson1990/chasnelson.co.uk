title: "Revolutions in Modern Light Microscopy"
event: "Bearsden & Milngavie University of the Third Age"
event_url: "https://u3asites.org.uk/bam/page/57490"
location: "Bearsden, UK"
summary:
abstract: "Microscopy and imaging provide some of the most visually
exciting and scientifically informative data available to the biosciences. Many revolutions have happened in light microscopy - from the development of fluorescent imaging to current advances in using artificial intelligence to produce super-resolved images. But there are still many challenges that must be solved by the combination of clever biology, clever physics and clever computing."
