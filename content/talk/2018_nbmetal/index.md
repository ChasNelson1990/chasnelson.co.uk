title: "Imaging the developing heart: synchronized time-lapse microscopy during developmental changest"
event: "SPIE Photonics West BIOS"
event_url: "http://spie.org/conferences-and-exhibitions/photonics-west/bios"
location: "San Fransisco, CA USA"
summary:
abstract: "How do you use imaging to analyse the development of the heart, which not only changes shape but also undergoes constant, high-speed, quasi-periodic changes? We have integrated ideas from prospective and retrospective optical gating to capture long-term, phase-locked developmental time-lapse videos. In this paper we demonstrate the success of this approach over a key developmental time period: heart looping, where large changes in heart shape prevent previous prospective gating approaches from capturing phase- locked videos. We use the comparison with other approaches to in vivo heart imaging to highlight the importance of collecting the most appropriate data for the biological question."
