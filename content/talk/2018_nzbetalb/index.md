abstract: "Although the low-impact nature of light sheet microscopy has opened up new avenues for developmental timelapse imaging, the heart remains a particularly challenging organ to image in 3D timelapse. To image processes on timescales of minutes to hours (such as heart development, cell migration, repair and regeneration) demands some form of synchronized image acquisition in order to separate the high-frequency heartbeat motion from the lower-speed morphological changes of interest. Although current postacquisition synchronization methods are attractive for imaging the beat process, or for acquiring small numbers of timepoints, the accumulated light dose precludes longer-term timelapse imaging. Indeed, we will show that this rapidly induces catastrophic photobleaching, phototoxicity and heart arrhythmia."
