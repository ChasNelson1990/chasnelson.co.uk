title: "A Bioimage Informatics QVEST: Quick, Versatile and Easy Segmentation & Tracking System"
event: "Society for Experimental Biology"
event_url: ""
location: "Manchester UK"
summary:
abstract: "Often bioimage informatics solutions are developed on a case-by-case system and, once complete, little research goes in to developing the systems for a wide spread of applications. Here we demonstrate how a single image analysis technique can be used to segment objects in different 3D microscopy images including tracking through time series, segmenting complex shapes and segmenting multiple objects in a single image, including touching or clustered objects. We have used our speedy and robust deformable mesh system to segment a variety of different objects and track them through time series of images. We have designed a vector field-driven active mesh with a novel local termination method, using directional constraints for tracking and simple pre-processing steps for different scenarios. We feel this is the first step to developing a system that is Quick, Versatile, i.e. capable of dealing with many different scenarios with equal accuracy and precision and Easy to use for a range of bioimaging Segmentation and Tracking needs: this is our QVEST."
