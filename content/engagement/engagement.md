### Policy Engagement

Research drives forward society. Whether it's the study of blue skies problems, the development of new technologies or understanding the social impacts on health and well-being. It is important that policy makers are aware of the current evidence available, of its meaning and its shortcomings. As such, I actively try to engage with policy makers at a range of levels.

As a PhD student I interned at the BBSRC on their <a href="https://bbsrc.ukri.org/about/reviews/scientific-areas/bbsrc-strategic-review-of-bioimaging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Strategic Review of Bioimaging</a> (see also <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/wolfson.institute/wrinews/?itemno=28134" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>). And I am also engaging with national policy makers through my work with the Royal Society of Biology in Scotland and other learned societies (see below).


### Public Engagement and Outreach

Public engagement is a really important part of modern science - much of which is funded by tax-payers and public donations. As such, I am regularly involved in public lectures and events such as <a href="https://www.cafescientifique.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cafe Scientifique</a> meetings. I have also helped out in the organising of such events, including <a href="https://pintofscience.co.uk/events/glasgow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pint of Science Glasgow</a>.


Recent and up-coming meetings include:

  * 15th January 2018 - <a href="https://www.cafescientifique.org/index.php?option=com_contentbuilder&controller=details&id=1&record_id=145&Itemid=478" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cafe Scientifique Cockermouth</a>
  * 2nd April 2018 - <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/events/cafescientifique/events/revolutionsinlightmicroscopy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cafe Scientfique Glasgow</a>
  * 27th February 2018 - <a href="https://www.events.iop.org/e/iops-public-lecture-series-glasgow-36dbf71a72a645329cdd35da37a512d9/page.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IOPS Public Lecture Series Glasgow</a>

### Involvement with Learned Societies

Learned societies provide a strong conduit for public and policy engagement as well as bringing scientific communities together. I am a member of three learned communities: the <a href="https://www.rsb.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Royal Society of Biology</a>, the <a href="https://www.rms.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Royal Microscopical Society</a> and the <a href="https://www.iop.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Institute of Physics</a>.

Further, I am an Ordinary Member on the committee for the Royal Society of Biology in Scotland, where I have begun to work closely with the policy committee on several projects.
