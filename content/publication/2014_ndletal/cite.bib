 abstract = {This article outlines a procedure for speeding up segmentation of images using active mesh systems.  Active meshes and other deformable models are very popular in image segmentation due to their ability to capture weak or missing boundary information; however, where strong edges exist, computations are still done after mesh nodes have settled on the boundary.  This can lead to extra computational time whilst the system continues to deform completed regions of the mesh. We propose a local termination procedure, reducing these unnecessary computations and speeding up segmentation time with minimal loss of quality.},
