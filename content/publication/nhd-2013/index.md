abstract: "Networks are present at all scales of biology from ecology to the sub-cellular networks that support cell architecture. The functional capabilities of a network emerge from the complexity and properties of its connections. The appearance of physical networks ca3n be captured by bioimaging technologies such as fluorescence microscopy, however manually extracting the critical structural information from these images is time consuming and virtually impossible for the unaided researcher when considering three-dimensional networks. Bio-networks such as the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons are inherently dynamic, their functions requiring “re-wiring” over time. Comprehending this four-dimensional problem and understanding the consequences to function caused by alterations in network dynamics is an impenetrable task without the support of advanced bioinformatics. The TANGL project will aim to develop, validate and disseminate biological resources and bioimage informatics solutions to enable robust extraction and quantitative characterisation of the architecture and dynamics of 3D and 4D (3D time-series) biological cytoskeletal networks."
