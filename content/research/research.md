## Research Interests

My research interests focus on two scientific areas:

  1. Understanding how the retina learns to processing visual stimuli.
  2. The interface of hardware, software and wetware in the pursuit of high quality, quantitative bioimaging.

Both of these areas requires the integration of skills from computing, engineering, chemistry and the life sciences. As such, my research career has moved me between disciplines and involves a large number of cross-disciplinary collaborations.

You can find my publications [here](https://www.chasnelson.co.uk/research/publications/).

## Current Research

How can babies see from the moment their born? How does the retina learn to process images before sending them to the brain? My current research is aimed at understanding these fundamental neuroscience questions by combining state-of-the-art light sheet microscopy, image analysis and network science.

I am doing this in the zebrafish (_Danio Rerio_), a popular model organism in microscopy due to it&#8217;s optical transparency and the wide range of fluorescence transgenic lines now available. Zebrafish are even more attractive as models for retinal developmental biology due to their relative simplicity but core similarities to mammalian retinal development.
