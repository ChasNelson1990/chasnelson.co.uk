### A Point of View on Microscopy Research, the History of the Microscope and a hint of Interdisciplinary Academia

My aim with this blog is to share with others some of my interests, mainly in microscopy and bioimaging. You can expect to see a few different styles of posts as detailed in  [Welcome to The Little Eye](https://www.chasnelson.co.uk/2017/06/19/intro/).

### Why “The Little Eye”?

I’ve taken the name The Little Eye from Galileo Galilei who coined his early compound microscopes: &#8220;Occhiolino&#8221;, Italian for &#8216;little eye&#8217;. The term &#8216;microscope&#8217; was coined by Giovanni Faber, a contempory of Galileo, and comes from the Greek words for &#8216;small&#8217; and &#8216;to look at&#8217;, intended to be analogous to &#8216;telescope&#8217; (see [Welcome to The Little Eye](https://www.chasnelson.co.uk/2017/06/19/intro/)).
