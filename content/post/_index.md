### A Point of View on Microscopy Research, the History of the Microscope and a hint of Interdisciplinary Academia

My aim with this blog is to share with others some of my interests, mainly in microscopy and bioimaging. You can expect to see a few different styles of posts as detailed in  [Welcome to The Little Eye]({{< relref "20170619_intro" >}}).

### Why “The Little Eye”?

I’ve taken the name The Little Eye from Galileo Galilei who coined his early compound microscopes: "Occhiolino", Italian for "little eye". The term "microscope" was coined by Giovanni Faber, a contempory of Galileo, and comes from the Greek words for "small" and "to look at", intended to be analogous to "telescope" (see [Welcome to The Little Eye]({{< relref "20170619_intro" >}})).
