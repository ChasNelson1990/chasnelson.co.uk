## About The Author

Hi! My name is **Chas Nelson** and I&#8217;m an interdisciplinary scientist with a background in computational microscopy and bioimaging. My research interests are at the interface where microscopy, computer science and biology must come together to answer important biological questions. I&#8217;m also very interested in multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity as concepts across teaching, research, funding and policy. I&#8217;m the author of this little blog and you can find out more about me at my <a href="https://www.chasnelson.co.uk/" rel="noopener">personal webpages</a>.

## About The Little Eye Blog

My aim with this blog is to share with others some of my interests, mainly in **microscopy** and bioimaging. You can expect to see a few different styles of posts:

  * Posts summarising the **latest microscopy research** and papers
  * Posts about **my own research**
  * Posts about the **history of microscopy**
      * Keep an eye out for the &#8216;timeline&#8217; tag, where I hope to start to build an **interactive timeline** of microscopy technologies
  * Outreach articles including some ideas for **experiments that can be done at home**
  * Posts about **academic life**

I will upload a post **every Friday**.

## Why &#8220;The Little Eye&#8221;?

I&#8217;ve taken the name _The Little Eye_ from the earlier name Galileo Galilei, a person who is likely to crop up in my history posts,  has given to describe the early compound microscopes: &#8220;Occhiolino&#8221;, Italian for &#8220;little eye&#8221; [1]. The term &#8220;microscope&#8221; was coined by Giovanni Faber, another person who&#8217;s likely to appear in one of my history posts, and comes from the Greek words for &#8220;small&#8221; and &#8220;to look at&#8221;, intended to be analogous to the contemporary telescope.
