## About Me

Hi! My name is **Chas Nelson** and I'm an interdisciplinary scientist with a background in computational microscopy and bioimaging. My research interests are at the interface where microscopy, computer science and biology must come together to answer important biological questions. I'm also very interested in multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity as concepts across teaching, research, funding and policy. I'm the author of this little blog and you can find out more about me at my [personal webpages]({{< relref "/">}}).

## About The Little Eye Blog

My aim with this blog is to share with others some of my interests, mainly in **microscopy** and bioimaging. You can expect to see a few different styles of posts:

  * Posts summarising the **latest microscopy research** and papers
  * Posts about **my own research**
  * Posts about the **history of microscopy**
      * Keep an eye out for the 'timeline' tag, where I hope to start to build an **interactive timeline** of microscopy technologies
  * Outreach articles including some ideas for **experiments that can be done at home**
  * Posts about **academic life**

I will upload a post **every Friday**.

## Why "The Little Eye"?

I've taken the name _The Little Eye_ from the earlier name Galileo Galilei, a person who is likely to crop up in my history posts,  has given to describe the early compound microscopes: "Occhiolino", Italian for "little eye" <a href="#G1998">[1]</a>. The term "microscope" was coined by Giovanni Faber, another person who's likely to appear in one of my history posts, and comes from the Greek words for "small" and "to look at", intended to be analogous to the contemporary telescope.
