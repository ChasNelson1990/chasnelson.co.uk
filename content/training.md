With a background in both data science and biology I am well aware of the importance of good programming and data skills for successful biological studies.
As such, I am actively engaged in training the community through learned society-sponsored training events.

Currently, I deliver two courses: [Python for Beginners](https://github.com/ChasNelson1990/python-zero-to-hero-beginners-course), which I teach through the [Royal Society for Biology](https://www.rsb.org.uk/events?layout=list&type=11), and [Bioimage Analysis in Python](https://github.com/IAFIG-RMS/Python-for-Bioimage-Analysis), which has been taught as part of the [Royal Microscopical Society's Image Analysis Focus Interest Group](http://iafig-rms.org/); however, I (and my colleagues) are working hard to make these resources openly available on-line as well.

If you're interested in organising a training course where you work, please [contact me via LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/chasnelson1990).
