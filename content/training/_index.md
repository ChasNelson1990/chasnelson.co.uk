## Training

With a background in both data science and biology I am well aware of the importance of good programming and data skills for successful biological studies.
As such, I am actively engaged in training the community through learned society-sponsored training events.

Currently, I deliver two [Python for Beginners]({{<ref "/python/index.md">}}) and [Bioimage Analysis in Python]() in person; however, I (and my colleagues) are working hard to make these resources openly available on-line as well.

Find out about in-person training opportunities [below](#in-person-training-opportunities).

If you're interested in organising a training course where you work, please [contact me](/index.html#contact).

## Teaching

My teaching interests focus on the development and delivery of resources that enable student-directed learning of programming languages and data skills.

### Teaching at the University of Glasgow

My undergraduate teaching at the University of Glasgow has included:

* the development of new Python learning materials for student-directed learning,
* research lectures on the <em>Frontiers of Physics</em>, where students are exposed to current research at the university; 
* and the development of a new practical experiments looking at polarisation and saccharimetry.

### Resources

Here are links to a few resources that I've put together as part of my teaching duties.

  * Slides and samples codes for my talk to engineering and computing sciences PhD students: _Harry Plotter and the Multiple Visualisation Softwares can be found on my GitHub account [here](https://github.com/ChasNelson1990/harry-plotter-resources)._
