### Teaching Interests

My teaching interests focus on two core areas that I consider essential to a well-rounded undergraduate science course: student-directed learning and transferable skills, particularly experimental design, data analysis and programming skills.

### Teaching at the University of Glasgow

My undergraduate teaching at the University of Glasgow has included first year Physics lectures on the <em>Frontiers of Physics</em>, where first year students are exposed to current research at the university, and the development of a new second year practical Physics lab looking at polarisation and saccharimetry.

### Teaching at Durham University

Before coming to Glasgow I taught at my previous university, Durham University. At Durham I taught a student-directed programming course, enabling first year Computer Science undergaduates to learn the Python programming language and develop their own abilities to find and explore resources that they'll use throughout their course and probably careers.

My response answer to a question in the class is "What terms have you searched for?" as the internet is _the_ modern resources for programmers and an ability to utilise resources such as Stack Overflow or your favourite search engine (mine is DuckDuckGo; try `!so Python 3`) I find is the key difference between an independent learner/researcher in later years and a student who's just getting grades.

### Resources

Here are links to a few resources that I've put together as part of my teaching duties.
