As part of my LKAS Research Fellowship in Data Science, I have been investigating how event-based sensors can be used to improve the speed of light sheet fluorescence microscopy.
I hope this research will open up new possibilities for very fast volumetric imaging of highly dynamic biology, e.g. the beating heart or calcium imaging of neurons.

My contribution to this work is funded by my LKAS Research Fellowship in Data Science (University of Glasgow).
