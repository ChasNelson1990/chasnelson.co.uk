Working with researchers at Durham University, the University of Essex and the University of Exeter, I published an article focussing on the benefits of using object-based approaches to quantify colocalisation experiments.
The article highlighted not only the benefits of such an approach but the importance of understanding the underlying algorithms and their assumptions by showing the biases and uncertainties of the approach.

My contribution to this work was funded by EPSRC.
