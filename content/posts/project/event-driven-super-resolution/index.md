Co-supervising a PhD student at the University of Glasgow working on super-resolution microscopy, particularly STORM-like approaches, we have been investigating how event-based sensors can be used to improve speed and throughput in super-resolution techniques.
We hope this research will open up new possibilities for different fluorphores and for real-time super-resolution imaging.

My contribution to this work is funded by my LKAS Research Fellowship in Data Science (University of Glasgow).
