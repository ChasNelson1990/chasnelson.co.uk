At Durham University, my PhD research focussed on the use of mathematical morphology to quantify biological and medical images.
One such challenge was the automated detection of ellipse-like objects, such as cell nulcei, in fluorescence microscopy.
Working with colleagues, I developed a new approach to identifying ellipses based on Hilbert-edge detection and ranging (HEDAR) and assumptions based on the shape on an ellipse.

My contribution to this work was funded by EPSRC.
