As a LKAS Research Fellow in Data Science and, previously, an EPSRC Doctoral Prize Research Fellow (University of Glasgow), I am investigating the use of graph theory, the mathematical background to network science, to understand how networks of neurons change organisation throughout development.
In particular, I am developing analysis pipelines for the quantitative exploration of whole-brain zebrafish calcium imaging experiments and mouse retin multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings.

My contribution to this work is funded by my EPSRC Doctoral Prize Research Fellowship and my LKAS Research Fellowship in Data Science (University of Glasgow).
