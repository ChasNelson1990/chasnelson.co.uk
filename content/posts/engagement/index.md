## Policy Engagement

Research drives societal changes.
Whether it's the study of blue skies problems, the development of new technologies or understanding impacts on public health, researchers and policy-makers need to keep engaged.
It is important researchers work to ensure policy makers are aware of the current evidence available, of its meaning and its shortcomings.
As such, I actively try to engage with policy makers at a range of levels.

I am actively engaged with national policy makers through my work with the Royal Society of Biology in Scotland and other learned societies (see below).

As a PhD student I interned at the BBSRC on their <a href="https://bbsrc.ukri.org/about/reviews/scientific-areas/bbsrc-strategic-review-of-bioimaging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Strategic Review of Bioimaging</a> (see also <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/wolfson.institute/wrinews/?itemno=28134" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>).


## Public Engagement and Outreach

Public engagement is an important part of modern science - much of which is funded by tax-payers and public donations.
As such, I am regularly involved in public lectures and events such as <a href="https://www.cafescientifique.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cafe Scientifique</a> meetings.
I have also helped out in the organising of such events, including <a href="https://pintofscience.co.uk/events/glasgow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pint of Science Glasgow</a>.


Recent events include:

  * [Pint of Science Glasgow]({{<ref "talk/2019_pos/index.md">}})
  * [7 Minutes of Science]({{<ref "talk/2019_7min/index.md">}})
  * [Cafe Scientifique Cockermouth]({{<ref "talk/2019_cafe-sci/index.md">}})

## Involvement with Learned Societies

Learned societies provide a strong conduit for public and policy engagement as well as bringing scientific communities together.
I am an active member of two learned communities:
* the <a href="https://www.rsb.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Royal Society of Biology</a>, for which I am a member of the Scotland branch council and Scotland policy committee;
* and I am a Fellow of the <a href="https://www.rms.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Royal Microscopical Society</a>, for which I am engaged in the Image Analysis Focus Interest Group.
