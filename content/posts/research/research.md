## Research Interests

My research interests focus on two scientific areas:

1. Bringing together hardware, software and wetware in the pursuit of high quality, quantitative and smart bioimaging;
2. Innovative data-driven solutions for bioimage analysis to accelerate biological discovery.

Both of these areas requires the integration of skills from computing, physics and the life sciences. As such, my research career has moved me between disciplines and involves a large number of cross-disciplinary collaborations.

You can find my publications [here]().

Below are some the projects I am currently and have previously worked on.
