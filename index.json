I\u0026rsquo;ve already written about a few of these in my earlier post and in this post I\u0026rsquo;ll summarise some key topics from the second day.\nAs mentioned in my last post this and my last post are a brief summary of just some of the ideas and messages that particularly spoke to me. Whilst I have referenced speakers throughout many of these points are my own interpretation and opinion.\nUKRI and Research Culture Tuesday started with a plenary by Sir Mark Walport, Chief Executive of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). Sir Mark highlighted UKRIs vision of a research culture which was open, respectful, driven by a balance of curiosity and scepticism, supported by rigour and open to constructive and kind challenge - of dogma, of results, of interpretations. I\u0026rsquo;m sure many science researchers would agree that these tenets are indeed important to a healthy science research culture. However, as Sir Mark said, there is no single magic bullet that will solve any problems we currently have.\nAttitudes and Beliefs Much of Tuesday fits under this title. Problems in attitudes were identified and many changes were proposed. These spanned Professor Tom McLeish\u0026rsquo;s suggestion to open all the doors in to and out of the palace of science - not just the main door. This was echoed by Dr Jenny Rohn who challenged the notion that staying in academia was the main route and everything else \u0026lsquo;alternative\u0026rsquo;.\nThis is all supported by the ideas of broadening what we see as success, e.g. not just a professorship with lots of grant money, raised by Professor Andrea Brand. Further, Robert-Jan Smits said his indicator of a culture change will be when data scientists and other, similar technical and research support roles are fully represented in paper author lists.\nThis was again mirrored in the afternoon\u0026rsquo;s session where David Sweeney, Executive Chair of Research England, said that an ideal future would be a research culture where the global academic enterprise was not driven by the top 1%. Those top 1% stand on the shoulders not just of giants but of the 99%, many of whom do the day-to-day research and community building that drive science forward.\nIn Conclusion There\u0026rsquo;s a great deal more I could write about from these two days. Many fantastic talks, inspiring ideas and important stories. If you want to see for yourself then both days were recorded and the YouTube links are available on the Royal Society\u0026rsquo;s pages here.\nBut what will I do. I am hoping to start making small changes in my day-to-day work, including:\n highlighting when meetings are held at non-family/carer friendly hours making sure researchers in my group take time to get out of the office/lab together make any outputs from my research fellowship 100% open and, in doing so, support and engage with new open science platforms, such as OCTOPUS (see last week\u0026rsquo;s post).  And, last but not least, take a bit more time to reflect on how my practices and those of academics around me might be contributing to negative aspects of the research culture I am part of.\n","permalink":"/posts/the-little-eye/research-culture-2/","summary":"It\u0026rsquo;s now been two weeks since I attended the Royal Society\u0026rsquo;s Research Culture - Changing Expectations meeting and it\u0026rsquo;s amazing how many topics from the meetings have come up organically in conversations with other academics, particularly early career researchers.

This meeting is a culmination of a two year programme of events and consultations (see here).\nThe meeting was full of inspiring speakers and great ideas and this and my next post are a really very brief summary of just some of the ideas and messages that particularly spoke to me. I have referenced speakers throughout but some of these points may be my own interpretation and opinion.\nResearch Culture Change - It can Happen The conference started with a talk by Dame Julia Slingo, former Chief Scientist at the Met Office. Dame Julia\u0026rsquo;s talk was a great way to kick of the meeting. Rather than talking about the ongoing challenges or ideas for the future, Dame Julia spoke about the research culture and environment at the Met Office when she began and the changes she implemented and how they impacted the culture, e.g. by improving diversity. One key idea that rose was the idea of 20% of researchers\u0026rsquo; time set aside for continuing professional development (CPD). This idea came up again and again, often paired with the idea of a universal research income, i.e. some small amount of money available to all researchers with or without grants.\nFeatures of an Ideal Future Research Culture Following this there was an interactive panel chaired by Dame Georgina Mace. The panel proposed many revolutionary ideas of what an ideal future research culture would be. Dr Eugenia Cheng proposed removing duplicated effort by removing formal peer-reviewed journals and throwing out the current grants system. Dr Adam Rutherford agreed and further advocated the increasing of GDP spend on science and innovation in the UK. Dr Rutherford suggested that a substantial increase in funding would help with diversity and inclusivity and funding for early career researchers (ECRs).\nThe idea of giving scientists jobs and not grant, as per Dr Cheng\u0026rsquo;s comments, were of particular interest to Dr Richard Massey, a Royal Society University Research Fellow. Dr Massey proposed an ECR structure that mirrored the UK junior doctor system - researchers fresh out of their PhD are hired by universities as \u0026lsquo;junior scientists\u0026rsquo; for a set time period. During this time these junior scientists may rotate through multiple labs or projects but they have the job security and CPD time needed to develop their own research ideas, applications and professional skills.\nThis career structure not only solves many ECR problems, e.g. lack of job security, constantly moving city, having to look for the next job as soon as you start this one, but also supports interdisciplinary researchers at this vital career stage. In the analogy of Dr Louise Heathwaite this will help to create a combination of \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo;s, \u0026lsquo;T\u0026rsquo;s, and \u0026lsquo;X\u0026rsquo;s. \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo;s are traditional disciplinary scientists with excellent narrow expertise. \u0026lsquo;T\u0026rsquo;s have an interdisciplinary base but still have a focus on a narrow area. \u0026lsquo;X\u0026rsquo;s, where I think I sit, have an interdisciplinary base, are able to identify a narrow niche but then actively bring in interdisciplinary ideas to answer that question.\nThe Pitch - Competition Final As part of the Royal Society\u0026rsquo;s programme people were invited to submit ideas that could positively affect research culture. Many ideas were submitted and the top six were invited to a Dragon\u0026rsquo;s Den-esque session. I related to one in particular - \u0026lsquo;Octopus: a radical new approach to scientific publishing\u0026rsquo;, one of the winning entries.\nOctopus, presented by Dr Alexandra Freeman, isn\u0026rsquo;t just about making publication open access but aims to completely break away from the traditional self-contained journal article concept. The journal article was devised in 1665 - over three and half centuries ago! When developed, it fitted the bill perfectly. The natural philosophers of the time studied many areas and journal articles needed to summarise the background, details the processes and present the results in the fewest printed pages possible. Having everything in one document made sense at the time.\nNowadays a field might see new articles every day! Each of these has an introduction that summarises the same research as other papers. The methods in these articles probably mirror the methods used by others or indeed in past papers by the same authors. The new and exciting bits are often the results, analyses and interpretation.\nIn Octopus, Dr Freeman and colleagues hope to break the traditional journal article into smaller chunks. If a scientist has a new hypothesis, they publish just that hypothesis, citing supporting results and analysis chunks already published separately. If a scientist thinks new information can be gained from some already published data they could run a new analysis and publish only this, citing the original results chunk.\nIn the Octopus world, scientists publish little but often. Peer-review is done online and openly through comments and ranking. This opens up science, speeds up science and minimises a lot of duplicated effort - excellent!\n","permalink":"/posts/the-little-eye/research-culture-1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eEarlier this week (29-30th October 2018) I attended a meeting at the Royal Society (London) with an aim of considering the UK scientific research culture - identifying challenges, highlighting best practice and considering what the future UK research culture can and should be.

Given that so far this year I’ve spoken about my current research - imaging the beating zebrafish heart - to audiences of academics, the public \u0026amp; students I thought it was about time to do a blog post summarising said research. Hopefully this short post will provide you with an idea of what we’re trying to achieve, why and how we’re going about it (although I\u0026rsquo;ve kept off too much detail for now).\nThe Challenge of a Beating Heart Here at the University of Glasgow I am working with Dr Jonathan Taylor on techniques for imaging the living, beating heart in zebrafish. This work is part of a British Heart Foundation funded collaboration between us and a team of biologists at the University of Edinburgh. Our collaborators are interested in quantifying how the heart responds to injury, which in turn can be used to develop drugs that improve the natural injury response. Eventually, the fundamental research being carried out in the zebrafish can be translated to other model organisms and may, after much validation, be trialled in humans. At a conference I attended earlier in the year, one speaker gave the (uncited) statistic that 22 out of 24 drugs developed in the zebrafish have been successfully translated to humans despite the differences between a fish heart and a human heart.\nSo that’s why our collaborators are interested in imaging the heart, but what are the challenges? Well, the primary challenge is that the living, beating heart is doing just that – beating. Generally, 3D fluorescence microscope images are built up by collecting several 2D images at different depths in the sample. The constant motion of the heart means that, in order to capture 3D fluorescence images of the heart, one must either be able to capture an entire 3D image very quickly, quicker than most fluorescence microscopes can achieve, or one could slow down, stop or pace the heart so that each 2D fluorescence plane can be captured at the exact same ‘phase’ or point in the heart beat cycle.\nProspective Optical Gating Unfortunately, intervening in the heart beat with drugs or electricity then starts to alter heart function and shape and may, over prolonged periods, introduce damage to the heart and other tissues in the fish. If we’re interested in imaging injury response we need to avoid accidental injury caused by our imaging. In other organisms, such as mice and humans, an echocardiogram (ECG) signal can be used to capture synchronised images in a technique known as gating [1].\nUnfortunately, attaching an ECG to a 3 mm long zebrafish embryo is challenging and very invasive. The approach we take at Glasgow is to use an non-invasive and gentle infrared video of the heart; this is the optical aspect of the approach. Using the concepts of gating with this optical source of information we can ‘computationally freeze’ the heart [2]. We use real-time computer algorithms to predict, this is the prospective bit, when to capture each 2D fluorescence image at a specific target phase. We are able to do this without the use of drugs or electrical stimulation. This allows the heart to continue beating completely naturally whilst we build up synchronised 3D snapshots (one 2D fluorescence images per heartbeat) of the heart at a target phase. Below you can see an example of a 3D taken with and without the synchronisation provided by our optical gating approach.\nSynchronised 3D Imaging of the Heart (from [2])  This approach actually has additional benefits. Not only can synchronised 3D images be collected without intervening in the heart’s natural processes but by ‘computationally freezing’ the heart, we are able to track the true motion of injury response cells, such as as macrophages. If we were to naively capture a constant video of the beating heart, any macrophages in our images would be constantly moving in and out with the heartbeat. By freezing the heart, this high frequency in-out motion is removed and we are able to track the motion of cells across the surface of the heart.\nThe 3Rs Part of the work that I\u0026rsquo;ve been focussing on during my time at Glasgow is to help improve the system so that instead of only being able to capture short timelapse videos, e.g. one 3D stack ever two minutes for half an hour to an hour, we able to capture timelapse videos over timescales relevant to development and injury-response, e.g. 12+ hours.\nA standard approach to this would be to injure a batch of fish and image different fish at different timepoints throughout the injury-response process. Each fish might then be killed so that imaging becomes a simple process; however, this leads to a drop in blood pressure and a change in heart and blood vessel shape.\nAlternatively, the heart might be imaged in the living fish; however, common imaging approaches other than the optical gating described above often cause a response in the heart such as a change in heart rate. We\u0026rsquo;ve even seen a macrophage, i.e. injury, response to one alternative imaging approiach. As such, these approaches can\u0026rsquo;t be used at several timepoints in a single fish as the imaging itself could be inducing an injury response - the very thing we\u0026rsquo;re trying to measure.\nBy improving our optical gating approach so that timelapse images can be taken over 24 hours or more (see [3] for the technical detail) we\u0026rsquo;ve developed a system that can reduced the numbers of animals needed in an experiment and refined the experiment by minimising invasiveness and possible injury. These are two of the 3Rs, the guiding principles of using animals in research [4] (see my earlier post).\nThe 3Ps Finally, this approach has benefits in terms of phototoxicity, photodamage and photobleaching (the 3Ps). By only capturing one 2D fluorescence image per heartbeat we reduce the amount of light being applied to our fish in comparison to high-speed, constant imaging. This reduces the effects of phototocixity and photodamage, which often manifest as a change in heart rate or, in extreme cases, the recruitment of macrophages and other injury response cells.\nFurther, if the fluorophore being imaged is particularly susceptible to photobleaching, an often dramatic loss of brightness, then the low-light nature of our system will reduce the impact this has on imaging. Thus allowing imaging for longer with minimal changes in intensity of signal.\nThe Beat Goes On\u0026hellip; With recent improvements in our algorithms we are now able to capture images of a computationally frozen heart for over 24 hours. This allows our collaborators to count and track macrophages and neutrophils for several hours after an induced injury. We are also able to follow morphological changes throughout heart development in zebrafish embryos. Our collaborators are now using these technologies to allow quantified, high resolution imaging of heart injury response. Hopefully this will lead to new discoveries in cardiac repair that, after further research, might make their way in to humans.\nIn the future we hope to improve this system further, combining state-of-the-art optics and computational approaches to improve the system robustness, temporal and spatial quality and further reduce the amount of light being pumped into the system.\nP.S. We are currently putting this work together as a new paper which we hope to submit in the coming months – expect pretty pictures and videos.\nReferences  See this article for great descriptions of gating in CT imaging https://xrayphysics.com/cardiac_ct.html.

I was describing how, when imaging living animals under the microscope, we strive to keep laser power levels to the minimum needed. The question I got in return was: \u0026ldquo;Is that for the animal\u0026rsquo;s sake or for the imaging?\u0026rdquo;. And of course the answer is both - in general, I find that good science and better microscopy align very well with performing more humane animal research.\nThis article is about how researchers are working to improve animal research by minimising numbers used, sharing animals and data and refining experimental procedures. This is not an article on whether or not animal experimentation should or should not be done; that is a matter of personal ethics. However, should you be interested in the rules and regulations surrounding animal research in the UK, I would suggest you start with Understanding Animal Research [1] and the National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (the NC3RS) [2].\nPrinciples of the 3Rs The 3Rs of Replacement, Reduction and Refinement having been guiding principles for the ethical use of animal research for almost 60 years now [3]. There are many places that state definitions but, for ease, these are the definitions as used by NC3RS:\n Replacement - Accelerating the development and use of models and tools, based on the latest science and technologies, to address important scientific questions without the use of animals.\nReduction - Appropriately designed and analysed animal experiments that are robust and reproducible, and truly add to the knowledge base.\nRefinement - Advancing research animal welfare by exploiting the latest in vivo technologies and by improving understanding of the impact of welfare on scientific outcomes.\n All three of these principles are important to better science and collecting better data.\nReduction Reduction is perhaps the simplest of these three principles and the one that most clearly relates to excellence in science. Reduction refers to approaches that minimise the number of animals used in research. Importantly, reduction refers to using the minimum number of animals needed to answer the scientific question under study.\nReduction can be accomplished by all researchers by incorporating best practices in experimental design, analysis and statistics [4]. This also ensures robust, reproducible findings - a central tenet of best scientific practice.\nMany projects aimed at reducing animal numbers take the form of improving longitudinal studies - studies that take measurements at several time points. With many approaches such studies require the killing of N animals per time point. By incorporating state-of-the-art imaging technologies we are able to image each animal at all time points without killing animals; thus, the number of animals drops from tN, where t is the number of time points, to just N.\nUsing the same animals at each time point also helps to reduce the confounding effect of between-animal variation. Animals, like humans, often show wide variation between individuals and using a completely distinct sample of animals at each time point can obscure small temporal effects.\nThe use of advanced imaging can also reduce animal numbers by allowing multiple organs or tissues to be imaged within a single animal. For example, one might be interested in the effect of a new cancer drug on cancerous and healthy tissues within an animal. With clever, non-invasive imaging approaches this can be achieved with minimal concern that the acquisition of one dataset affects the other.\nFurther, imaging experiments can produce massive swathes of data. With appropriate infrastructures, scientists can share these datasets and allow other scientists to re-use and re-analyse the data and also combine their data with other datasets to help answer scientific questions without any further animal research.\nRefinement But, as scientists, we must be careful that reduction of numbers is balanced with refinement of experiments.\nRefinement is a bit more difficult to measure and there may be totally unique refinements needed for a particular animal experiment. Refinement refers to the modification of experimental design such that experiments still answer the scientific question in mind whilst minimising both short-term and long-term pain, suffering and distress in the animals use. Refinement can occur out of the lab, e.g. at the husbandry stage, or during experimental procedures.\nWhen we use high power light to image animals, particularly over long time periods, we face issues relating photodamage and photobleaching (see my earlier post). In order to get reliable imaging data we must minimise various factors relating to light exposure and powers. But these also have a distinct effect on the welfare of the animal being imaged. Continuous, high power exposure to laser light, particularly blue/UV light can be very damaging to the animals we\u0026rsquo;re imaging. This leads to unreliable data, which we don\u0026rsquo;t want.\nObviously, this is a clear place where the aims of good science and the principles of the 3Rs align perfectly. Intense light exposure can cause short-term pain and distress, particularly in a restrained animal, and negative impacts on our data.\nSimilarly, we must be very careful with our use of anaesthetics and analgesics, which we often use to minimise distress, suffering and pain during experimentation. These drugs may minimise suffering during the experiment but some anaesthetics have been shown to be distressing when introduced to, for example, aquarium water [5]. Using these drugs may also introduce a confounding effect on the data being taken, for example - how do anaesthetics affect neuronal signally?. Here we find an area where joint research needs to be carried out to improve experimental Refinement but also ensure we understand the confounding effects of these drugs.\nReplacement And last, but definitely not least, we come to the Replacement of animals by either animals that we consider not to experience suffering, e.g. insects, or by completely replacing animal models with humans, cell cultures or computational models.\nOften, the experiments that scientists must do to answer questions about such things as disease, immune response and drug development cannot be carried out in humans for a variety of ethical, practical and scientific reasons. Similarly, when probing questions at the very frontiers of science, computational models may not exist. Further, cells and tissues often behave differently in synthetic scenarios than in living organisms. What this means is that sometimes, to answer certain questions, research must be done with living animals. It should be noted that research in animals also has its own challenges, which sometimes make it an unsuitable route to take.\nActually, research in microscopy and bioimaging, particularly for biomedical research is often about using cell cultures and tissue models and much research uses human-derived cells and tissues. However, a fair part of biomedical research, particularly, for example, neuroscience, required the imaging of live animals. Here imaging isn\u0026rsquo;t, in the short-term, aligned with the principles of the 3Rs.\nHowever, many imaging techniques are able to gather masses of data. By making this data freely available, microscopy experiments done now can be used to build the mathematical and computational models of the future. Thus, current imaging experiments in living animals can contribute to the Replacement of animals in future years.\nConcluding Remarks As mentioned at the beginning of this article, this is not an article on the ethics of animal research but I hope that this broad overview of how the principles of Replacement, Reduction and Refinement of animals in research aligns with the central drive of many researchers: better science. One day, hopefully in the not-to-distant future, we will be able to move away from animal experiments altogether but, until that time, we strive to make these experiments as non-invasive and as stress-free for our animals as we can.\nReferences  Understanding Animal Research (https://www.understandinganimalresearch.org.uk/).

The day is run as part of their Voice of Young Science network [3] and aims to help early career scientists launch themselves into the rather intimidating field of media engagement.\nThe workshop itself was a really interesting day so thanks to Chris Peters and Ana Skamarauskas for organising and chairing through the day. It was primarily composed of three very interactive panels: scientists who have communicated with the media, journalists who work in STEM-related media, and the \u0026rsquo;nuts and bolts\u0026rsquo; panel.\nThe Scientists Probably the most interesting for me was the first. Three scientists from different fields gave use their experience of engaging with the media. Professor Claire Halpin [4] spoke about her experiences before the GM debate struck the UK, her experience as the debate reached it\u0026rsquo;s most controversial and her work in public perception of GM crops.\nDr Mario Vellejo-Marin [5] gave his experiences as a younger researcher working in a less controversial topic: plant evolutionary biology. Mario described how an enthusiastic conversation at a Professor\u0026rsquo;s party with somebody who turned out to be a science journalist has led to several news and television appearances for him and his new species of plants, an example of less person-centric research still being of great interest to the public.\nProfessor Sergio Della Sala [6] gave the audience his advice and opinions on what we should be communicating with the media. He warned the audience of the dangers of being too media happy and reporting on unconfirmed, unreviewed or wrong results and put the responsibility of safe scientific reporting not just on the media but very much on the scientists who are engaging with the media.\nThe Journalists The second session was revealing of the limitations and frustrations of reporting science from the view of two freelance journalists (Jane Feinmann, a medical journalist [7], and Wendy Grossman [8], a technology and freedom writer) and a TV correspondent (Kevin Keane of the BBC [9]). Key messages were that if you make a press release through the university, but then go on holiday, then don\u0026rsquo;t be upset if your competitor is the one speaking on the news at six. Further, if you don\u0026rsquo;t engage with the journalists trying to report your science then the risk of them misinterpreting you results or the significance increase. Basically: the more we as scientists are available and happy to engage, the better science journalism will occur.\nAn additional point, which is very important to remember, is that not all journalists are science-specialists and even those who are don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily know you tiny bit of science. As journalists, their job is to take an overwhelmingly complex and nuanced piece of science and simplify it for the audience in questions. That might mean taking your three years of work and condensing it into a 90 second TV slot. As scientists, we should be aware of the challenge involved and a) help this process by expressing our research in an already simple way and b) not getting upset by the \u0026lsquo;over simplification\u0026rsquo; of our work but try to communicate which are the important bits and why their important.\nThe Nuts and Bolts The final session was a mixed panel: Beatriz Goulao [10], a PhD student, statistician and ambassador in the Ask for Evidence campaign [11], Jen Middleton [12], a PR manager at the University of Edinburgh, and Lindsay Murphy, former Assistant Director and now Scottish Programme Coordinator for Sense about Science and owner of Be Experimental [13].\nHere the panel was able to give the audience insight into the connections between scientists and journalists. The support, training and platforms available through organisations like Sense about Science and the Voice of Young Science network, through learned bodies, e.g. BSA Media Fellowships [14], and funding organisations and through university press officers.\nMy Take So, what are my take home messages?:\n Researchers need to be open and proactive about talking to the public and the media. It\u0026rsquo;s only through this transparency that we can prevent misunderstanding. If you are speaking to the media: prepare. Prepare a message that you\u0026rsquo;d like to get across, prepare simplified forms of your discipline\u0026rsquo;s jargon, just prepare. Scientists are public figures: they usually receive public funding, their research does impact the public and the public are, often, extremely interested in what science is happening. Scientists can engage with the media at a range of levels: maybe you jut want to discuss your direct research, or just the field, but you could also engage with the media and public when you see bad science, or science being reported in an irresponsible way.  I think a lot of the rest comes with experience, talking to those who have experience in engaging the media, talking to those in the media. So, those of us in science who have yet to do so: why not dig in? Why not get involved in campaigns like Ask for Evidence? Or highlight bad science or reporting by contacting the reporters/outlets involved? Or, just as a start, why not attend a similar session yourself?\nReferences  https://senseaboutscience.org https://senseaboutscience.org/activities/media-workshop/ https://senseaboutscience.org/what-we-are-doing/voys/ https://www.lifesci.dundee.ac.uk/people/claire-halpin https://www.plant-evolution.org/wp/ https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/sergio-della-sala https://www.janefeinmann.com/ https://www.pelicancrossing.net/bio.htm https://twitter.com/kkeaneBBC https://www.abdn.ac.uk/hsru/people/beatriz.goulao/ https://www.askforevidence.org/index https://www.ed.ac.uk/communications-marketing/press-and-pr https://www.beexperimental.co.uk/ https://www.britishscienceassociation.org/media-fellows ","permalink":"/posts/the-little-eye/standing-up-for-science/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eToday I attended the Sense about Science \u003ca href=\"#sas\"\u003e[1]\u003c/a\u003e media workshop: Standing up for Science \u003ca href=\"#workshop\"\u003e[2]\u003c/a\u003e.

He is particularly known for two achievements: his single-lens microscopes, the best of which was able to resolve objects down to 1 micrometre (a thousandth of a millimetre), and being the first human to explore the microcosm - the world of single-cell organisms such as algae and bacteria. It is for the latter that he is often ascribed the sobriquet of \u0026lsquo;The Father of Microbiology\u0026rsquo;.\nThe Man Van Leeuwenhoek was born into the burgeoning and learned Dutch Republic. Delft, his home city, was heavily involved in foreign trade through the Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie (the Dutch East Indies Company) and it was through trade as a draper that van Leeuwenhoek primarily earned his living. He supplemented his trade with various roles in public office throughout his life, including as the official wine-gauger of Delft.\nTo my knowledge there isn\u0026rsquo;t much third party documentation of van Leeuwenhoek, his parents or either of his marriages and one surviving child, Maria. However, Lens on Leeuwenhoek includes a timeline of over 600 documented events relating to van Leeuwenhoek\u0026rsquo;s life, his family and Delft during his lifetime.\nThe Letters Much of what we know of van Leeuwenhoek\u0026rsquo;s scientific work comes from his self-published collections of letters. These letters, written in Dutch, were published in seven volumes and totalling 364 letters of which 285 include scientific notions. Nearly all these letters are dated and addressed to individuals or specific bodies, including many to the Royal Society.\nA few of these letters were published, usually only in extracts, in English, Latin and French. These publications were few and far between and included publications such as Philosophical Transactions (the world\u0026rsquo;s first exclusively scientific journal).\nLike many early scientists, van Leeuwenhoek was a broad, observer and questioner of the natural world: a natural philosopher. His letters include observations of grains and fruits, including the tropical coconut, pig brains, mouse tendons, sheep testicles and uteri, fish, hair and skin samples. and more. Many of these were supported by copper engravings of his observations also published with his letters.\nThe Microscopes As a curious, self-taught man, van Leeuwenhoek was not afraid of trying his hand at a new challenge. In one of his civil roles, as surveyor, he would have been well aware of telescopes and, as a draper, he would have used low magnification glasses for determining thread count. Van Leeuwenhoek learnt to make his own glass lenses and to grind and to smith his own metal parts. With these skills he went on to make at least 559 microscopes and no doubt more that didn\u0026rsquo;t work, broke or were lost. He averaged over one microscope a month over 60 years of designing and building them.\nVan Leeuwenhoek is most known for his single-lens microscopes, of which he made at least 271, but he also constructed a variety of other microscope in other designs. His single-lens microscopes, of which eleven have survived, where constructed of from a convex-convex (or spherical) lens, to metal plates, a mount and several threaded components all riveted together, of which van Leeuwenhoek will have made all. The surviving microscopes are only in brass and silver but some microscopes would also have been made in gold.\nThe threaded components of van Leeuwenhoek\u0026rsquo;s microscope design allowed him to secure the mounted specimen and, one of the unique features of his design, control the position of the mount in three dimensions and rotationally.\nThe lenses he used in these microscopes were amazingly small, uniformly round and of clear enough glass that he was able to observe objects smaller than any person before him. He was the first to observe and describe single-cell organisms, including bacteria down to a micron in diameter.\nThe Specimens Many of van Leeuwenhoek\u0026rsquo;s minuscule discoveries were described in his letters in the classic, observational style of the time. Obviously in Dutch, he often described these micro-organisms as \u0026rsquo;exceedingly small animals\u0026rsquo;. In a translation of his early letters this was translated as \u0026lsquo;animacules\u0026rsquo;, a word often associated with van Leeuwenhoek.\nVan Leeuwenhoek\u0026rsquo;s jobs as cloth merchant and surveyor well prepared him for the new world that he discovered through his microscopes: he was a diligent observers of this new microcosm and counted and measured these new micro-organisms. His calculations were laborious and, being before modern standardisation, relied on unusual units. For example, comparing the width of 100 red blood cells as less the the diameter of a grain of sand.\nThe Legacy Anthony van Leeuwenhoek was probably the discover of hundreds and hundreds of new species and micro-organism and opened up a whole new scale of the universe. Scientifically, his work really was as revolutionary as, say, the helio-centric model of the solar system; although I don\u0026rsquo;t believe van Leeuwenhoek ever relates his observations to God\u0026rsquo;s universe. His legacy is the collections of his letters and observations, his microscope designs and devices and, most importantly, the inspiration of almost 400 years of microbiologists, naturalists and microscopists.\nBibliography My thanks go to Professor Douglas Anderson and colleagues for all their work on Lens on Leeuwenhoek, a database of collected documents, including letters and plates, events and other resources aimed at collating information about van Leeuwenhoek and his life into a taxonomical database. Much of the above information comes from reading these pages.\n","permalink":"/posts/the-little-eye/antony-van-leeuwenhoek/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAntony van Leeuwenhoek is one of the most well known figures in the history of microscopy.

Early microscopes used ambient light or used mirrors to reflect light, either from the sun or a candle, onto the sample of interest. With the inventions [1] of the electric light bulb additional, artificial light sources could be used and the light from lamps could be focussed onto samples with much greater control.\nFluorescent proteins (see 2008 on my interactive timeline) brought a new round of light technologies to microscopy, with one of the most common light sources for confocal microscopes being the mercury arc lamp. Combined with appropriate filters, the mercury lamp, along with xenon and tungsten lamps, provides a powerful light source suitable for exciting low quantum yield [2] fluorescent proteins.\nRecently, LED light sources have begun to take over from arc lamps. Their mass production driven by consumer technology has made them cheap, easy to get hold of and remarkably reliable. LEDs can be found in single, narrowband set-ups, i.e. able to excite only specific fluorescent molecules, or in broadband, i.e. white, forms that can be combined with filters for greater flexibility.\nBut, one of the most important light sources in modern, state-of-the-art microscopy is the LASER. LASERs, or Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation devices, are extremely clever pieces of equipment (and a full description of them is technically beyond this blog). Essentially a laser amplifies an initial light source through stimulating the release of photons of a known length from an excited medium, or dye. Lasers have many benefits for microscopy including their known and very narrowband spectrum, i.e. very specific wavelengths are produced, and their coherence, which allows tight focussing and control of the spatial structure of the light.\nLight vs. Biologists: Round One! So, as microscopy technology has developed we\u0026rsquo;ve moved to stronger, more specific and more focussed light sources. And this has, in turn, allowed us to get clearer, higher resolution images and is now allowing optical microscopy to near the resolutions achieved by electron microscopy. But using light has its costs and, as microscopists and biologists, it\u0026rsquo;s very important for us to keep these costs in mind.\nI think it\u0026rsquo;s fair to say that a lot of biology doesn\u0026rsquo;t really like light. Obviously, there are systems that have developed to exploit the energy provided by the suns light, e.g. photosynthesis, but light, and the energy contained, causes lots of problems to our cells. For example, if you sunbathe without protection the energy from UV rays, which are just a wavelength of light, cause damage to your DNA, which you cells must correct. A combination of mutations caused by UV and various causes, along with genetic predisposition, can lead to skin cancers [3]: a clear negative effect of light on biology.\nIn fact, all light has an effect on biological tissue, especially at shorter wavelengths (green and blue visible light, UV light). Unfortunately, until very recently, producing bright blue, green and yellow fluorescent proteins has been significantly easier than developing bright far-red and near-infrared proteins. As such, a significant amount of microscopy in recent years has been firing damaging light on our samples.\nBiologists vs. Light: Round Two! All is not lost. Although the damage light causes during microscopy can be severe, most microscopy is done at low light levels, often the lowest that allow us to see the biology of interest. Further, a dialogue has recently opened up in the community as to the best ways to measure, record and publish how we are using light and the effect this might have on the biology concerned [4].\nThis dialogue is extremely important but it must be a discussion that transcends disciplinary boundaries (transdisciplinary) and manufacturers and developers of microscope technologies must be as aware of and as open about the problems of light damage (photodamage/photoxicity) as biologists.\nBiologists vs. Light: Round Three! A Knockout\u0026hellip;? Well, no. But with some clever design and thinking microscopists can develop systems that minimise the energy transferred to our samples from light. For example, in my current research, we are using a low intensity, infrared LED for constant imaging of zebrafish hearts. This light has a minimal to negligible effect on the fish.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re able to use this low-damage imaging to trigger the capture of fluorescent images at very precise times, i.e. at specific points within the heartbeat. These fluorescent images, individually, also have a minimal effect on the fish\u0026rsquo;s health and stress levels. We are then able to computationally build a 3D image of the beating zebrafish heart and monitor the changes over hours and days to understand development, healing and regeneration.\nAlternative approaches to the problem of capturing images at specific points in the heartbeat have been to capture lots of fluorescent images at a high rate and computationally work out which ones were actually at the point you wanted afterwards. This is not only inefficient with your data but taking large numbers of these fluorescent images within a short timespan can have serious effects on heart and immune system activity.\nBiologists vs. Light: The Fight Continues \u0026hellip;\nReferences  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescent_light_bulb#History https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_yield https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/sun-uv-and-cancer/how-the-sun-and-uv-cause-cancer Unfortunately neither of these are fully Open Access, sorry.

This is off the back of the Government\u0026rsquo;s Industrial Strategy Green Paper [2] and aims to investigate, amongst other things, whether or not the Government has the infrastructure to support an innovative life sciences sector in the UK.\nAs somebody with a passion for bioimaging I thought I might stress the importance of bioimaging and similar supporting technologies. Without technologies such as bioimaging and next generation sequencing, the UK biosciences and bioeconomy would not be the innovative and world-class scene that it is. So, here it is, my two pence worth.\nThe Importance of Bioimaging Bioimaging is probably the dominant form of analysis within the biosciences and occurs at a wide range of scales: from molecules to whole organisms. Further, imaging is used across the life sciences from biomedical and veterinary science through to microbiology and agriculture; thus it has a major role in both fundamental life sciences and the life science industry.\nThe advancement of the bioimaging field is rapid, as with many other supporting technologies, and new methods for quantification and analysis are further expanding the scope and power of such technology. In order to maintain the UK\u0026rsquo;s position as a world leader in life science innovation, bioimaging must be fully supported and advances must be capitalised.\nLike many other supporting technologies, bioimaging is a multidisciplinary field and requires research and interaction with many other disciplines. Further, important new techniques can arise in bioimaging through translation from seemingly disparate disciplines, e.g. adaptive optics from astronomy. As such, a narrow-approach to life science innovation or even to supporting the broader spectrum of life science technology and research must be avoided. Life science innovation comes from across the board and the Government needs to recognise and structure its systems appropriately.\nThe Bioimaging Ecosystem To enable such a multidisciplinary field, and especially to push commercialisation, as industry is a central aspect of this inquiry, the entire bioimaging ecosystem, including enabling technologies, must be well supported and invested in; for bioimaging this goes right from lasers and detectors through to labelling and probes and beyond, both in academia and industry.\nFurther, support and invest must work at multiple levels: not only does the UK life science community need access to state-of-the-art bioimaging, but support and funding must be available to maintain strong workhorse equipment and facilities. Nowadays most cell biologists will use a confocal microscope as a standard tool and these need be easy to access and supported for maintenance and turnover but may traditionally attract less funding due to their very nature of being workhorse instruments. It\u0026rsquo;s worth noting the excellent standard of UK bioimaging facilities at academic institutes and how important they are to enabling world-class bioscience research; these facilities are important not just for access to essential bioimaging technologies but also as centres of training, expertise and knowledge.\nPeople and Skills All the technology on the planet might be rendered useless without well-trained people with the appropriate skills. This requires training at all career stages, and arguably at secondary education level too, ranging from statistics and data literacy into practical skills. Data and coding skills are, in particular, a key area of concern in the biosciences community, without which the potential of state-of-the-art bioimaging equipment cannot be reached.\nA strong research community requires not just project leaders and PhD students but also strong staff scientists and technical staff. The career paths for the whole spectrum of those involved in academic and industrial bioscience need to be clear, supported and sustainable through training and professional opportunities.\nData Not only is it important to have data literate researchers, to work across disciplines to foster better data quantification approaches and to integrate data from different modalities (both within and without imaging) but it is important to be able to share data. Sharing requires community driven standards but, for such a data intensive technology as bioimaging, a strong data infrastructure both at local institutions and across the UK is essential. The current UK data infrastructure may well not be up to the data requirements of future bioimaging technology and the enabled biosciences.\nAnd so much more\u0026hellip; I could go on. But I won\u0026rsquo;t. I\u0026rsquo;m sure similar arguments can be made for many different fields that form the foundation of the UK\u0026rsquo;s world-class biosciences and really I guess the point I\u0026rsquo;m making is that an innovative life sciences industry in the UK can only thrive with an innovative life sciences research community, which in turns relies on advances in its supporting technologies, such as bioimaging. The Select Committee must bear this in mind in their inquiry.\nReferences  https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/science-and-technology-committee/news-parliament-2017/life-sciences-industrial-strategy-inquiry-launch/ https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/building-our-industrial-strategy ","permalink":"/posts/the-little-eye/future-of-uk-life-sciences/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast month the House of Lords Science and Technology Select Committee, which scrutinises Government policy relating to science and technology, announced an inquiry into the future of UK life sciences \u003ca href=\"#lsis\"\u003e[1]\u003c/a\u003e.

This is most evidenced when you consider that, when funding such equipment at UK universities and research institutes, many funding bodies stipulate a requirement for sharing across multiple research groups or institutes. However, as developers of new microscopy technology a focus on such fancy and costly microscopes should not be at the detriment of the continued research into miniaturisation, cheaper manufacturing and improved transportable microscopes.\nWhy Do We Need Small and Cheap Microscopes? But, why do we need small, cheap and transportable microscopes? Surely the exciting microscopy is done with powerful lasers, fancy optics and performed by Nobel Prize winners? Whilst some of the most beautiful and scientifically revealing images are indeed captured by some of the larger and fancier equipment out there, some of the most important applications of imaging technologies are in healthcare, particularly in the developing world.\nThese parts of the world are often very well connected by satellite and mobile networks and smart phones sales are surprisingly high. So, we have a problem of expensive and cumbersome microscopes\u0026hellip; and a solution of one of the most powerful devices we\u0026rsquo;ve ever come up with: a pocket-sized computer with a digital camera sensor and and high quality lens. A perfect pairing I\u0026rsquo;d say!\nBut How Good Can They Be? Suprisingly good! We\u0026rsquo;re obviously not the first people to ask that question and so I point you to this (open access) research article comparing smartphone microscopy and conventional microscopy in dermatology: https://dx.doi.org/10.5858/arpa.2014-0593-OA [1]. Obviously, the paper is quite technical but their abstract conclusion sums it up nicely:\n Mobile phone–based microscopy has excellent performance characteristics for the inexpensive diagnosis of nonmelanoma skin cancers in a setting where a traditional microscope is not available.\n Basically, whilst smartphone microscopes won\u0026rsquo;t surpass dedicated microscopes they workswell enough to be a reliable tool for microscopy and a cheap alternative too.\nWho Designs Microscopes for Mobile Phones? There\u0026rsquo;s quite a few research papers on mobile phone microscopes and plenty of open source projects trying to design equipment that can be cheaply produced, often 3D printed, for poorer regions of the Earth. As much of this research is open access, I\u0026rsquo;m just going to provide a short list of a few companies, papers and repositories for you to browse at your own leisure (in no particular order):\n Foldscope [2] is a low-cost, paper-based microscope that has been used for education and research across the globe. As well as their main website, which has an imaging community, see their Wikipedia page for examples of its use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foldscope. A cheap adapter for most smartphones sold by the Science Museum (https://www.sciencemuseumshop.co.uk/exhibition-ranges/wonderlab-collection/wonderlab-matter/smartphone-microscope.htm) can be a great way to introduce microscopy as fun family activity for investigating nature from rocks to insects. The Smartphone Microscope [3] is designed to be an easy to build and cheap platform to turn any smartphone into a fairly robust microscope. The designs for the original version are available on Instructables [4] and they also sell pre-fabricated versions. Keep an eye out for version 2.0, coming soon! A recent preprint article (open access) reported a simple, 3D printed adapter for smartphones that uses the internal camera flash as an illumination source [5]. And, last but not least, my favourite portable microscope is a smartphone-driven Lego Lightsheet Microscope!! The website it currently under construction but hopefully they\u0026rsquo;ll put all the details up soon at https://legolish.org/. (We might be planning to build this at work.)  There are more out their and there is an increasing movement for creating cheaper, open access, open source, research-quality tools. For example, the recent PLoS Biology (open access) paper on FlyPi, the low-cost, 3D-printable behavioural biology set-up by the Baden lab.

The Microscopical Society of London was the original name of what is now known as the Royal Microscopical Society. I hope to do a number of posts about the society, which is a very important learned society founded to promote,\n microscopical investigation, and for the introduction and improvement of the Microscope as a scientific instrument [1].\n What is the Royal Microscopical Society? First up, I should summarise what the society does (but you can find out more on their website). According to the Royal Microscopical Society\u0026rsquo;s (RMS) website [2] they are dedicated to furthering the science of microscopy through education and research. The society hosts and supports a wide range of events for training scientists at all level, encouraging networking and collaborations and conferences. The RMS also publishes the Journal of Microscopy [3], a members magazine, infocus, and a range of resources for professionals and enthusiasts.\nThe Founding of the Microscopical Society of London Right, back to the history bit. During the 1830s, several technical advanced in microscopes occurred, including the development of new objectives that massively reduced spherical aberrations, sample preparation and instrument design. Naturally, the increasing popularity of the microscope led to meetings of microscopists, including James Scott Bowerbank, the fourth President of the Society, who, at one such meeting, proclaimed,\n God bless the Microscope; let us have a society! [1]\n In September 1939, seventeen microscopists met with the intention of forming a formal body for the promotion and enhancement of microscopy. The seventeen members included Bowerbank, Joseph Jackson Lister (whose research led to the aforementioned improvements in objectives), Edwin J. Quickett (at whose home the meeting was held) and a mixture of entomologists, botanists, zoologists and anatomists.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve always wondered why the society has the long and slightly cumbersome \u0026lsquo;microscopical\u0026rsquo;. Apparently, this was at the insistence of the Revererend Joseph Bancroft Reade, one of the founding members and the society\u0026rsquo;s fifteenth President, who added the \u0026lsquo;-al\u0026rsquo; to prevent,\n the possibility of ourselves being mistaken for microscopic objects [1].\n The First Year A provisional committee was formed and a constitution drawn up. At a public meeting held in December that year Professor Richard Owen (not one of the original seventeen) was elected President, Dr Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward and Dr Arthur Farre (both of the original seventeen) took up the position of Treasurer and Secratary, respectively. A full council was appointed and a total of 45 men signed up to the society as this meeting.\nOne very important decision made by the provisional council was to purchase a cutting board and diamond cutter for the preparation of glass slides for sample mounting. The council decided that members of the society should use one of two size glass slides: 3 by 1 inch or 3 by 1.5 inch. Eventually 3 by 1 inch slides were adopted as standard across the community and industry. Although we\u0026rsquo;ve now moved onto metric measurements, the standard stands and modern microscopy slides are still the same size (75 by 26 mm).\nThe council agreed to have regular meetings of the society and an Anniversary Meeting (now the AGM). And the first Anniversary Meeting in February 1841 is where we will leave the society for now. I hope to explore other parts of the society\u0026rsquo;s history in future posts.\nReferences  Turner, G.L.E., 1989. God Bless the Microscope.

The idea behind this is to slowly build up an educational resource that documents key events and people in the history of microscopy. Eventually this timeline will go from the first compound microscopes, through electron and fluorescence microscopy and right up to modern techniques such as lightsheet and super-resolution.\nTimelineJS In order to construct this timeline I\u0026rsquo;ve started with an easy to build and easy to explore visualisation tool called TimelineJS. This allows me to build up a spreadsheet of events that are then compiled into an easy to explore timeline. Each event on the timeline will be linked to a blog post on that event (or person, or instrument). I may, if needs be, move the timeline to an alternative tool if the timeline becomes to complex to explore in TimelineJS. I may also choose to split the timeline into smaller chunks, for example, creating a dedicated timeline just from electron microscopy, we shall see.\nCurrently you can access the timeline here and through the \u0026rsquo;timeline\u0026rsquo; link at the top. In the near future I will sort out the plug-ins so that I can embed the timeline into it\u0026rsquo;s own permanent page on this site.\nA Starting Point - Nobel Prizes In order that I don\u0026rsquo;t start with a blank timeline I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to begin by adding all the Nobel Prizes that are related to microscopy. There are quite a few of these and they include the development of fluorescent probes (see 2008), detectors important to microscopy (see 2009), and the development of new microscope technologies, e.g. (see super-resolution techniques in 2014). I have not included any prizes where the research used microscopy, of which there are many, or the development of medical imaging, e.g. MRI, or spectroscopy, e.g. NMR, which are well outside of my field of expertise.\nNormally each event in the timeline will link to one of blog posts which introduces the event, research, person or instrument or discusses an important topic relating to that event. However, writing about all the Nobel Prizes relating to microscopy would take weeks and, given the excellent resources provided by the Nobel Prize website, for these initial events I have just linked to the appropriate award page on their website. From here you should find acceptance speeches, Nobel lectures and many additional resources, including a few on-line games.\nAdding Extra Events In the future, everytime I write a blog post about a specific event, person or technology in the history of microscopy I will add this to the timeline and, over the coming months, this will hopefully expand into a useful and interactive resource for me, educationalists and researchers.\nContributing to the Timeline Of course, if I only add to the timeline when I write a blog entry then it will take quite a while to build up the timeline. As such, I am more than happy to work with anybody who\u0026rsquo;s interested in contributing to the timeline in anyway.

The workshops (this was the last of three) were run jointly by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), the Engineering and Physical Sciences Reseasrch Council (EPSRC) and the Medical Research Council (MRC) to foster multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary networks and better integrate such research into the often disciplinary nature of the research councils.\nGiven the current changes in the research council structure, and the regularly recognised important of multidisciplinary research at this interface, can we expect to see a change in how the councils work together for better multidisciplinary research across the UK?\nThe Research Councils and RCUK/UKRI Briefly, I should introduce the research councils for those who don\u0026rsquo;t know what they are and what they do. Unfortunately, with the recent Higher Education and Research Bill [2], this will be probably be out of date by the time anybody reads it!\nCurrently, the UK research councils are seven government bodies that fund strategic research and develop training and communities across the whole of academia from arts to zoology. Until the recent bill they were partnered under the banner of Research Councils UK (RCUK), though they (in my experience) act as seven very separate bodies.\nWhere the research councils are going, under the new banner of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), will be interesting to see\u0026hellip; but, suffice to say, things may change over the coming years.\nMultidisciplinary UK Research and Innovation? The Technology Touching Life scheme seems to be, to me at least, an attempt by three of the research councils to a) change how the research councils deal with research that crosses between their remit, b) encourage the UK\u0026rsquo;s already excellent research community in that area and c) address problems and perceived problems of how multidisciplinary research is funded and supported between research councils.\nWhat do I mean by \u0026lsquo;multidisciplinary\u0026rsquo;, well really the terms cross-, multi- and inter-disciplinary have come to mean the same thing (although, in truth, there are subtle differences and the three form more of a spectrum): research, or researchers, that occurs between or in-between the traditional disciplinary units. A good example is my own field, microscopy and bioimaging requires researchers from optics, computing, chemistry and biology to work together to develop new instruments, analysis algorithms and labels to answer challenging biological questions.\nCurrently, a major (perceived at least) problem with multidisciplinary projects being submitted for funding by the research councils is the phenomena of proposals \u0026lsquo;slipping through the gaps\u0026rsquo; between the councils\u0026rsquo; respective remits. Whether or not this is true, it\u0026rsquo;s something that one hears again and again in academia at the interface of disciplines.\nTechnology Touching Life - Changing Perceptions to Solve Problems One solution might be to ring fence some money for research just in these areas\u0026hellip; sounds great, right? Well, one of the reasons that I personally have high hopes for the Technology Touching Life scheme is that it comes with no research funding: and that\u0026rsquo;s because throwing money at a such a cross boundaries area won\u0026rsquo;t change how the community and the councils approach multidisciplinary research and funding.\nThe Technology Touching Life scheme isn\u0026rsquo;t about funding, it\u0026rsquo;s about changing the way that the research councils and research communities work with multidisciplinary projects and researchers. It\u0026rsquo;s not about only letting only multidisciplinary researchers peer review multidisciplinary proposals, but rather better informing non-multidisciplinary researchers to recognise the impact research could have that transcends the classic disciplinary boundaries.\nThe challenges of multidisciplinary research and the problems of understanding and perception of such research are constantly reported on and commentaries on such challenges pop up again and again. The Technology Touching Life scheme won\u0026rsquo;t solve these challenges overnight, but as the research councils begin to morph into their new shape of UKRI, maybe this scheme can help shape them in a way that boosts the UK\u0026rsquo;s thriving multidisciplinary scientific community.\nP.S. The Maxwell Report (2014) and The Nurse Report (2015) It\u0026rsquo;s very important that I highlight here why and how the _Technology Touching Life _ scheme has come about. Essentially, in the last three years we have had two very important reports:\n The \u0026lsquo;Maxwell Report\u0026rsquo;, or \u0026lsquo;The Importance of Engineering and Physical Sciences Research to Health and Life Sciences\u0026rsquo; by Professor Patrick Maxwell, was an independent review published in 2014 by the EPSRC discussing the relationship between the engineering and physical sciences and health and life sciences [3]. The review considered how multidisciplinary institutes were structured, what research challenges exist at the interface and what role physical sciences have played and will play in life science research. The \u0026lsquo;Nurse Report\u0026rsquo;, or \u0026lsquo;Ensuring a Successful Research Endeavour: Review of the UK Research Councils\u0026rsquo; by Sir Paul Nurse in 2015, was a review produced for government about the past, current and future roles of the research councils in enabling the world-class research that happens across the UK [4]. It is this report that has lead to the Higher Education and Research Bill.  And, because of these reports and other factors, the research councils at the engineering and physical sciences boundary with health and life sciences have chosen to look at how they enable the UK\u0026rsquo;s multidisciplinary research in this area and what they can do to further that support.\nReferences  https://www.rcuk.ac.uk/research/xrcprogrammes/technology-touching-life/ https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/higher-education-and-research-bill https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/newsevents/pubs/the-importance-of-engineering-and-physical-sciences-research-to-health-and-life-sciences/ https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/nurse-review-of-research-councils ","permalink":"/posts/the-little-eye/technology-touching-life/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis Tuesday (the 20th June 2017) I attended a workshop on the new \u003cem\u003eTechnology Touching Life\u003c/em\u003e scheme being run by three of the UK\u0026rsquo;s research councils \u003ca href=\"#ttl\"\u003e[1]\u003c/a\u003e.

My name is \u003cstrong\u003eChas Nelson\u003c/strong\u003e and I\u0026rsquo;m an interdisciplinary scientist with a background in computational microscopy and bioimaging. My research interests are at the interface where microscopy, computer science and biology must come together to answer important biological questions. I\u0026rsquo;m also very interested in multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity as concepts across teaching, research, funding and policy.
