      <description>&lt;p&gt;2018 has been a busy year so far (and I expect it will stay that way) but I’ve finally made time to write another blog post (and also to move my blog into my personal website). Given that so far this year I’ve spoken about my current research - imaging the beating zebrafish heart - to audiences of academics, the public &amp;amp; students I thought it was about time to do a blog post summarising said research. Hopefully this short post will provide you with an idea of what we’re trying to achieve, why and how we’re going about it (although I&amp;rsquo;ve kept off too much detail for now).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Future of UK Life Sciences</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last month the House of Lords Science and Technology Select Committee, which scrutinises Government policy relating to science and technology, announced an inquiry into the future of UK life sciences &lt;a href=&#34;#lsis&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. This is off the back of the Government&amp;rsquo;s Industrial Strategy Green Paper &lt;a href=&#34;#industry&#34;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; and aims to investigate, amongst other things, whether or not the Government has the infrastructure to support an innovative life sciences sector in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As somebody with a passion for bioimaging I thought I might stress the importance of bioimaging and similar supporting technologies. Without technologies such as bioimaging and next generation sequencing, the UK biosciences and bioeconomy would not be the innovative and world-class scene that it is. So, here it is, my two pence worth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
