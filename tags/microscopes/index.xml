      <description>&lt;p&gt;2018 has been a busy year so far (and I expect it will stay that way) but I’ve finally made time to write another blog post (and also to move my blog into my personal website). Given that so far this year I’ve spoken about my current research - imaging the beating zebrafish heart - to audiences of academics, the public &amp;amp; students I thought it was about time to do a blog post summarising said research. Hopefully this short post will provide you with an idea of what we’re trying to achieve, why and how we’re going about it (although I&amp;rsquo;ve kept off too much detail for now).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Antony van Leeuwenhoek is one of the most well known figures in the history of microscopy. He is particularly known for two achievements: his single-lens microscopes, the best of which was able to resolve objects down to 1 micrometre (a thousandth of a millimetre), and being the first human to explore the microcosm - the world of single-cell organisms such as algae and bacteria. It is for the latter that he is often ascribed the sobriquet of &amp;lsquo;The Father of Microbiology&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;light-is-an-essential-aspect-of-microscopy&#34;&gt;Light is an Essential Aspect of Microscopy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An essential aspect to microscopy is light. Early microscopes used ambient light or used mirrors to reflect light, either from the sun or a candle, onto the sample of interest. With the inventions &lt;a href=&#34;#bulb&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; of the electric light bulb additional, artificial light sources could be used and the light from lamps could be focussed onto samples with much greater control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Microscopes on Your Mobile Phone</title>
      <link>/posts/the-little-eye/mobile-phone-microscopes/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many modern microscopes can be large, highly technical and expensive pieces of equipment. This is most evidenced when you consider that, when funding such equipment at UK universities and research institutes, many funding bodies stipulate a requirement for sharing across multiple research groups or institutes. However, as developers of new microscopy technology a focus on such fancy and costly microscopes should not be at the detriment of the continued research into miniaturisation, cheaper manufacturing and improved transportable microscopes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
