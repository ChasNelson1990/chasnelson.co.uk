      <description>&lt;p&gt;2018 has been a busy year so far (and I expect it will stay that way) but I’ve finally made time to write another blog post (and also to move my blog into my personal website). Given that so far this year I’ve spoken about my current research - imaging the beating zebrafish heart - to audiences of academics, the public &amp;amp; students I thought it was about time to do a blog post summarising said research. Hopefully this short post will provide you with an idea of what we’re trying to achieve, why and how we’re going about it (although I&amp;rsquo;ve kept off too much detail for now).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Better Imaging of Living Animals and the 3Rs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I was explaining my research to another academic from a different field. I was describing how, when imaging living animals under the microscope, we strive to keep laser power levels to the minimum needed. The question I got in return was: &amp;ldquo;Is that for the animal&amp;rsquo;s sake or for the imaging?&amp;rdquo;. And of course the answer is both - in general, I find that good science and better microscopy align very well with performing more humane animal research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is about how researchers are working to improve animal research by minimising numbers used, sharing animals and data and refining experimental procedures.  This is not an article on whether or not animal experimentation should or should not be done; that is a matter of personal ethics. However, should you be interested in the rules and regulations surrounding animal research in the UK, I would suggest you start with Understanding Animal Research &lt;a href=&#34;#understanding&#34;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; and the National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (the NC3RS) &lt;a href=&#34;#nc3rs&#34;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
